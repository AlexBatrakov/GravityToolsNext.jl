# Examples

This directory contains end-to-end usage scripts that were originally used for manual testing.

Notes:
- Many scripts require external TEMPO/TEMPO2 binaries and data directories.
- Scripts may contain machine-specific absolute paths; treat them as templates.
- For CI-friendly unit tests (no TEMPO/TEMPO2 required), see the package test suite under `test/`.
